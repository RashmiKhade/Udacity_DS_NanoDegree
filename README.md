# Udacity_DS_NanoDegree
This repository will be used to host Projects related to Udacity's Data Scientist Nano Degree program.

The first project is for Term 2, related to analysing a dataset and writing a Data Science Blog Post based on the findings.

I have chosen 'Stack Overflows Developer Survey - 2018'. The survey consisted of various questions related to Education, Employment, Technology trend etc. Survey was answered by 98855 respondents ranging from Students to Professionals.

Here I have tried to analyse the effects of various factors on Job Satisfaction.

There is 1 notebook which has the related code which needs the following libraries to run

- pandas as pd
- numpy as np
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- seaborn as sns
- sklearn.cluster
- sklearn.metrics
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
- sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler
- scikitplot.skplt

The findings have been put in a blog which can be found at https://medium.com/@rashmi.khade/top-3-findings-related-to-job-satisfaction-ed0ce074a72a
